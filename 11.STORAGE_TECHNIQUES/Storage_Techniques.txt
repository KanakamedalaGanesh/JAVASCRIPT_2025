Storage Techniques in Js : Storage in JavaScript is a way to store data locally on the client-side. 
It is a key-value pair storage system that allows you to store data in the browser's memory. 
There are several types of storage techniques in JavaScript, including: Local Storage, Session Storage, and IndexedDB.

### Local Storage : 
Local Storage is a type of storage that allows you to store data locally on the client-side. 
It is a key-value pair storage system that allows you to store data in the browser's memory. 
It is similar to cookies, but it is more secure and has a larger storage capacity. 
It is also more efficient than cookies because it does not require a round trip to the server to store data .
It is also more secure than cookies because it is not sent to the server with every request.
It is also more efficient than cookies because it does not require a round trip to the server to store data .
It is also more secure than cookies because it is not sent to the server with every request.



### Session Storage :
Session Storage is a type of storage that allows you to store data locally on the client-side.
It is similar to Local Storage, but it is only available for the duration of the session.
It is a key-value pair storage system that allows you to store data in the browser's memory.
It is similar to cookies, but it is more secure and has a larger storage capacity.
It is also more efficient than cookies because it does not require a round trip to the server to store data . 
It is also cleared when the user closes the browser. 
It is used to store data that is only needed for the duration of the session. 
It is also used to store data that is sensitive and should not be stored on the server.
It is also used to store data that is only needed for the duration of the session.
It is also used to store data that is sensitive and should not be stored on the server.



### IndexedDB :
IndexedDB is a type of storage that allows you to store data locally on the client-side.
It is a key-value pair storage system that allows you to store data in the browser's memory.
It is similar to Local Storage, but it is more powerful and flexible.
It is also more efficient than Local Storage because it allows you to store larger amounts of data.
It is also more efficient than Local Storage because it allows you to store data in a more structured way .
It is also used to store data that is sensitive and should not be stored on the server.
It is also used to store data that is only needed for the duration of the session.
It is also used to store data that is sensitive and should not be stored on the server.
It is also used to store data that is only needed for the duration of the session.
